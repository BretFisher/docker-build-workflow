# Docker Build and Push GitHub Actions Workflow

A Reusable Workflow of the Docker GitHub Actions steps. Enhanced with learnings from production use.

## Reasons to use this workflow

1. Easier to start with than hand-building all the Docker Actions into a single workflow.
2. Provides inline docs based on real-world usage of this workflow.
3. Gives you inputs so you can reuse this workflow across many repositories and only needing the full workflow stored in a central repository.

## Steps to adopt this workflow

1. Fork this repository and tweak the reusable workflow to your liking: [.github/workflows/reusable-docker-build.yaml](.github/workflows/reusable-docker-build.yaml)
2. Copy my "calling" workflow [`templates/call-docker-build.yaml`](templates/call-docker-build.yaml) to all the repos you want to build images in, and change it to point to the forked workflow above.

## "But what does this workflow really do beyond just `docker build`?"

1. Clone the repository
2. Setup QEMU for multi-platform building (buildx) via docker/setup-qemu-action
3. Setup buildx for awesome and fast building via docker/setup-buildx-action
4. Log into Docker Hub and/or GHCR
5. Add labels and tags via docker/metadata-action
6. Build and push image via docker/build-push-action with layer caching
7. Reports tags and labels in the PR comments
